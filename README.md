# CIV102-Bridge-Project

The goal of this project is to design a bridge which can withstand a minimum of 400N.
Matlab code was written to calculate the bending moment and shear force the bridge may experience, failure moments and forces were also produced by Matlab. Engineering drawings were also done for the final design of the bridge.
